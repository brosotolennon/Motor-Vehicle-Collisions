**Project Title:** Motor Vehicle Collision Database

**Overview:** 

This project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database to analyze motor vehicle collisions in New York City, specifically on New Year’s Eve of 2017. Leveraging data collected by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the database aims to enhance traffic safety by providing insights into collision patterns and contributing factors.

**Database Description:**

Our database is tailored to analyze motor vehicle collisions in New York City on New Year’s day 2017. This specific focus was chosen to capture data relevant to high-traffic periods and diverse populations. The database consists of nine interconnected tables, covering vehicle information, driver details, collision specifics, and damage reports.

**Questions about the data:**

- Which type of car model (SUV, Sedan, etc) most likely got into an accident?
- How many men vs. women were the driver of a sedan in a collision?
- What vehicle type caused damage to public property and at what time?
- Which car company had the most collisions?
- What time period had the most collisions?

**Special Considerations**

The dataset is extensive, requiring significant data cleanup.
Data involves sensitive information about traffic incidents and personal injuries.
